# Placeholder Fix Verification

- Processed locales: de, en, es, tr.
- Placeholder mismatches resolved: 0.
- Final status: All locales now match the default placeholder sets (English reference).

## Validation Steps

1. Reviewed `reports/i18n/placeholders.json` to confirm expected placeholders for each key.
2. Compared locale strings programmatically to ensure placeholder tokens align across languages.
3. Verified `reports/i18n/placeholders-mismatch.md` reports zero inconsistencies.

No additional locale string updates were required.
